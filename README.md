# What is open source software?
_"Open Source"_ refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible

_"Open Source Software"_ is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.

### Examples
* [Node.js JavaScript runtime](https://github.com/nodejs/node)
* [Linux kernel](https://github.com/torvalds/linux)
* [Atom - The hackable text editor](https://github.com/atom/atom)
* [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails)
* [The MongoDB Database](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo)
* [Kickstarter's iOS app](https://github.com/kickstarter/ios-oss)

### Why are projects open source?
Projects become open source for a multitude of reasons. Here is non exhaustive list:
* **Increase Software Adoption**: Software developers can trust software that they can inspect, modify, and enhance. If a developer trusts a piece of software then they would feel more inclined to use it.  
* **Increase Software Quality**: Open source software is publicly accessible to the world and encourages collaboration. Since its publicly accessible, bug fixes and security improvements can be implemented by anyone.
* **Share Progress**: Businesses don't want to solve the same problems over and over. In the software industry, companies open source their software to make it easier for other companies to solve the same problems.

# How to get started in open source on GitHub
GitHub is the largest open source community in the world. It's also the easiest place to start contributing. The following is a beginners guide on how to start contributing to open source projects.

### Finding where to contribute
Lots of open source projects can seem intimidating. Experience developers create projects that are sometimes complicated and difficult to understand. Sometimes these projects might have some low hanging fruit (easy changes to make). This low hanging fruit is usually a good place to start.

The following are some great places to find some beginner issues:
* [Up For Grabs](http://up-for-grabs.net/) - List of projects which have curated tasks specifically for new contributors.
* [issuehub.io](http://issuehub.io/) - Contribute to Open Source. Search issue labels to find the right project for you!
* [FIRST TIMERS ONLY](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/) - Friendly Open Source projects should reserve specific issues for newbies.
* [Your First PR](http://yourfirstpr.github.io/) - Your First PR helps you get started contributing to Open Source by showcasing great starter issues on GitHub and elsewhere.
* [Awesome First PR Opportunities](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners) - A list of awesome beginners-friendly projects.

After finding that golden issue that you hope to start working on, be sure to go and understand some of the code base first.
